# Egg On Rice Controller
 Micro hitbox-style controller for arcade games. Utilizes the Brook UFB.
 Heavily inspired by the "Mille-feuille" by Pomeran. https://pomegd.booth.pm/items/2685530

**Why is it called "Egg On Rice"? Yeah, I don't know either.**

- *Feel free to modify the files to your needs and specifications but credit me for the original files please.*

- *Most of the parts used will be linked or named in the materials.txt file.*

- *The switch footprints were made with Kailh Choc v1 switches in mind.*

- *The keycaps may be too low and sit flush with the top acrylic panel. Please modify either the stem length or the blocker length to your needs.*

- *No RGB because it hurts my eyes. (I'm just too lazy to implement it.)*

 USB Type-C Connection because we live in 2020s A.D, not 2020s B.C. Micro USBs should just die.  
 (However, USB-Cs are a pain in the ass to solder, but again, I'm bad at soldering.)

 6 tactile push switches for menu navigations.  
 (I don't even own a PS4 or Xbox, wtf do these buttons even do.)  
 From left to right (in playing position): Home, Touchpad, LSB (huh), RSB (what), Share, Option (the only one I use).

 I couldn't find a M6 screw feet without sacrificing the overall thickness of the board, so I made the thing feetless.  
 (The back does kinda look clean, though.)

 I'm sorry for my bad photography skills.  
   
 Here's a picture of the PCB using a PCB viewer.

## Anyways, I hope you find this useful <:^) ##
As a wise man said, "If a fightstick exists, slap a UFB onto it and it will work."
