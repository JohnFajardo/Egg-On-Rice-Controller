 Feel free to modify the files to your needs and specifications but credit me for the original files please.

 Most of the parts used will be linked or named in the materials.txt file.

 The switch footprints were made with Kailh Choc v1 switches in mind.

 The keycaps may be too low and sits flush with the top acrylic panel. Please modify either the stem length or the blocker length to your needs.

 Have fun <:^)
